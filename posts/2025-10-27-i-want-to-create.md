# I Want To Create

*October 27, 2025*

My first post!!! This is exciting

I have been wanting to create more lately and so this is a place where I can create and synthesize my thoughts or post about whatever I want because this is my site and I can control it. I have been feeling like I am doing too much consuming. I consume so much instragram and youtube these days and it's actually quite sad. I don't want my life to be dictated by whatever Meta gives me to watch. It feels like I have no control and I am just giving my time away to. I have had periods where I get myself off of instagram, but I innevitably have a slump in my mental health, and go right back. 

Even when I am not doomscrolling, I feel like my time is not always spent creating, especially during the school semester. Being a computer engineering student (which I don't necessarily even want to be), much of my work is projects that are implementing something within the strict guidelines of what the class needs. Yes I am generally creating, writing, and debugging code, which does require some amount of creativity. However, in the end I submit to an autograder or run some test script that the output that gives me governs how I sculpt the project I am creating. I don't get to decide the scope of any project, what I want to implement, or find a cleaver way to do something. Because of this, even my school work doesn't feel like creation. 

And so, I have decided that it is time that I actively pursue creation. I am someone who has had a lot of fun creating in the past, and I need to actively make time to allow that person to create. The main form of creation I do on a daily basis is cook which I am pretty good at. I want to do more though. I want to get good at making arguments, synthesizing my thoughts on subjects and putting it into writing. I also want to photograph more. I have taken film pictures in the past and would like to get back into it. 

This is my first creation of this website. Creating the website itself was an act of creation. I am keeping it simple to use in that I can just write a markdown file and it will make the post. I am quite happy with the setup of this blog for now. I don't want the mechanics of the blog to get in the way of just creating and populating it. So this post and this website is the first thing I am creating on here. Hopefully the first of many.
